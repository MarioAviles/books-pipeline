Foreman;John Wiley & Sons;2013-11-12;en;Computers;"Data Science gets thrown around in the press like it's magic. Major retailers are predicting everything from when their customers are pregnant to when they want a new pair of Chuck Taylors. It's a brave new world where seemingly meaningless data can be transformed into valuable insight to drive smart business decisions. But how does one exactly do data science? Do you have to hire one of these priests of the dark arts, the ""data scientist,"" to extract this gold from your data? Nope. Data science is little more than using straight-forward steps to process raw data into actionable insight. And in Data Smart, author and data scientist John Foreman will show you how that's done within the familiar environment of a spreadsheet. Why a spreadsheet? It's comfortable! You get to look at the data every step of the way, building confidence as you learn the tricks of the trade. Plus, spreadsheets are a vendor-neutral place to learn data science without the hype. But don't let the Excel sheets fool you. This is a book for those serious about learning the analytic techniques, the math and the magic, behind big data. Each chapter will cover a different technique in a spreadsheet so you can follow along: Mathematical optimization, including non-linear programming and genetic algorithms Clustering via k-means, spherical k-means, and graph modularity Data mining in graphs, such as outlier detection Supervised AI through logistic regression, ensemble models, and bag-of-words models Forecasting, seasonal adjustments, and prediction intervals through monte carlo simulation Moving from spreadsheets into the R programming language You get your hands dirty as you work alongside John through each technique. But never fear, the topics are readily applicable and the author laces humor throughout. You'll even learn what a dead squirrel has to do with optimization modeling, which you no doubt are dying to know.";437.0;9781118661468;111866146X;;;2025-11-22 17:34:21;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781118661468

MATZ;;2025-01-07;en;Business & Economics;A refreshingly relatable exploration of how algorithms penetrate the most intimate aspects of our psychology, and how we can regain mastery over our lives--from the pioneering expert of psychological targeting. There are more digital pieces of data than stars in the universe. This data helps us monitor our planet, decipher our genetic code, and take a deep dive into our psychology. As algorithms become increasingly adept at accessing our minds, they also become more and more powerful at controlling it--enticing us to buy a certain product or vote for a certain political candidate. Some of us say this technological trend is no big deal. Others consider it one of the greatest threats to humanity. But what if the truth is more nuanced and mind-bending than that? In Mindmasters, Columbia Business School professor Sandra Matz offers a fascinating insider perspective on the art and data-driven science of psychological targeting. By relating her own personal story of growing up in a small village--where few aspects of life remain truly private--to her groundbreaking research in computational psychology, Matz reveals how Big Data offers insights into the most intimate aspects of our psyche and how these insights empower external influence over the choices we make. Filled with Ted-Talk-like explanations and real-life examples from Matz's research and consulting work, Mindmasters paints a nuanced picture of the power of psychological targeting. Like nosy neighbors, it can be creepy, manipulative, and downright harmful--with scandals like Cambridge Analytica being merely the tip of the iceberg. Yet, like any tight-knit, supportive village community, it also holds enormous potential to help us live healthier and happier lives--for example, by improving our mental health, encouraging better financial decisions, or enabling us to break out of our echo chambers. With passion and clear-eyed precision, Matz shows us how to manage psychological targeting and redesign the data game in a way that empowers us to take back control and ask more of our personal data. Mindmasters is a riveting look at what our digital footprints reveal about us, how they're being used--for good and for ill--and how we can gain more control and power over the data that define us.;0.0;9781647826314;1647826314;;;2025-11-22 17:34:24;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781647826314

Kelleher; Brendan Tierney";MIT Press;2018-04-13;en;Computers;A concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, relation to machine learning, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. The goal of data science is to improve decision making through the analysis of data. Today data science determines the ads we see online, the books and movies that are recommended to us online, which emails are filtered into our spam folders, and even how much we pay for health insurance. This volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series offers a concise introduction to the emerging field of data science, explaining its evolution, current uses, data infrastructure issues, and ethical challenges. It has never been easier for organizations to gather, store, and process data. Use of data science is driven by the rise of big data and social media, the development of high-performance computing, and the emergence of such powerful methods for data analysis and modeling as deep learning. Data science encompasses a set of principles, problem definitions, algorithms, and processes for extracting non-obvious and useful patterns from large datasets. It is closely related to the fields of data mining and machine learning, but broader in scope. This book offers a brief history of the field, introduces fundamental data concepts, and describes the stages in a data science project. It considers data infrastructure and the challenges posed by integrating data from multiple sources, introduces the basics of machine learning, and discusses how to link machine learning expertise with real-world problems. The book also reviews ethical and legal issues, developments in data regulation, and computational approaches to preserving privacy. Finally, it considers the future impact of data science and offers principles for success in data science projects.;282.0;9780262535434;0262535432;;;2025-11-22 17:34:35;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9780262535434

This is a deceptively challenging goal since there are no templates to work from. Establishing a project management office, information services, or human resources department is an understood process and does not vary greatly between organizations. Establishing an analytics team, by contrast, requires a significant up-front investment in understanding and contextualizing the initiative. Many organizations have attempted to use operating models and templates from other functions, in particular IT and operations research. This fundamental misunderstanding of where analytics fits within an organization has led to visible failures and has set back the analytical maturity of many organizations. Business leaders need to hire or develop data-centric talent who are able to step back from analysis and project management to view their work through a lens of value-creation. Understand how organizations and practitioners need to structure, build, and lead a successful analytics team – to bridge the gap between business leaders and the analytical function. The analytics job market is very frothy, and the talent pool has swelled in recent years with engineers, actuaries, and scientists up-skilling and re-branding themselves as data scientists. This influx of highly technical specialists with limited leadership experience has had negative consequences for the practice as a whole. Minding the Machines is organized in three key pillars: Strategy, Process, and People. Strategy – How to assess organizational readiness, identify gaps, establish an attainable roadmap, and properly articulate a value proposition and case for change. Process – How to select and manage projects across their lifecycle including design thinking, risk assessment, governance, and operationalization. People – How to structure and engage a team, establish productive and parsimonious conventions, and to lead a distinct practice with unique requirements. Analytical practitioners want to read this book because career progression opportunities for analytical professionals are very limited. Despite reaching senior technical roles they often report to a business focused manager who understands little about the analytical function. Practitioners seek leadership opportunities, but do not have the tools to move into leadership roles or to be successful in them. Business leaders with foundational analytical abilities want to read this book because what they may have learned from other business units is at best not applicable to analytics teams, and at worst counterproductive. There needs to be a resource specific to this unique practice. Students want to read this book because though they are developing strong technical abilities and learning the newest techniques, they are not being instructed in business leadership in an analytics context. This gap in education is amplifying the problem as the profession moves away from long-horizon highly technical solutions and towards a focus on immediate value.;240.0;9781119785323;1119785324;;;2025-11-22 17:34:44;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781119785323
